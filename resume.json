The composed TEE uses hardware intellectual property (IP) blocks, existing hardware-level protections, a hypervisor, Linux security module (LSM), and Linux kernel capabilities including a file system in order to provide the performance and multiple layers of confidentiality and integrity. Additionally, the TEE composition explores both open source and commercial solutions for achieving the same result.",

      "summary": "Vehicle and transportation systems provide a challenging use case for security, where physical and virtual access is virtually unlimited, and its relatively easy to procure replacement parts, components, and even whole vehicles to continue attacking a system. Given these challenges in the vehicle deployment model, the goal shifts from denying an attacker access, to limiting the damage an attacker can do once access is achieved. Specifically, the integrity and availability of the system (vehicle) must be maintained after a successful compromise. The use of encryption is only the beginning in terms of securing vehicle systems and is generally not sufficient to preserve the integrity of these systems during or after a successful attack.\nWe will address:\n1. Security fallacy of “just encrypt”\n2. Attack flow and overview (setting the stage for MAC) 3. Introduction of Mandatory Access Control (MAC)\n4. Kernel implementations of MAC\n5. Hypervisor implementations of MAC\n6. Further decreases to the attack surface",

He truly has both the breadth and depth of knowledge in the areas of Linux, embedded software, mission-critical systems, and cybersecurity.  More importantly, he is one of the few people that I can confidently say would truly understand the challenges and trade offs that occur in a production / design environment for any technology or product he is managing in the realm.\n\nAnother key strength JK brings to the table is his ability to drive business objectives and sales with smart solutions that work for the customer. In fact, his customer obsession has many times led to creation of products that helped the business while also providing our customers with the exact features they requested.
